# Approved Section Read-Only Fix

## Problem
In the Manager Dashboard, when clicking "View Details" on expenses in the **Approved** section, the manager could still see approve/reject buttons and edit the expense, which should not be allowed for already-processed expenses.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Updated ManagerDashboard.jsx

**Changed the `handleViewDetail` function** to pass expense status information:

```javascript
const handleViewDetail = (expenseId, expense) => {
    const isReadOnly = expense.status === 'Approved' || expense.status === 'approved' || 
                      expense.status === 'Rejected' || expense.status === 'rejected';
    navigate(`/manager/approval/${expenseId}`, { 
        state: { 
            isReadOnly: isReadOnly,
            fromTab: activeTab,
            expense: expense
        } 
    });
};
```

**Updated button text** based on tab:
- **Waiting Approval tab**: Button shows "Review"
- **Approved/Reviewed tabs**: Button shows "View Details"

### 2. Updated ManagerApprovalDetail.jsx

**Added read-only mode detection:**
```javascript
import { useParams, useNavigate, useLocation } from 'react-router-dom';

const isReadOnly = location.state?.isReadOnly || false;
const fromTab = location.state?.fromTab || 'waitingApproval';
```

**Added visual indicator for read-only mode:**
- Blue info banner at the top showing: "This expense has already been approved/rejected. View only - no edits allowed."

**Conditional rendering of action elements:**
- ❌ **Hidden in read-only mode:**
  - Approve/Reject buttons on expense items
  - Rejection reason textarea and submit buttons
  - "Submit Final Decision" section at the bottom
  
- ✅ **Always visible:**
  - Employee information
  - Expense summary (with enhanced status colors)
  - Approval workflow details
  - Approval history
  - Expense items with their details
  - Back to Dashboard button

**Enhanced status display:**
- Green (#10b981) for Approved
- Red (#ef4444) for Rejected  
- Orange (#f59e0b) for Pending
- Shows "Reviewed On" date when in read-only mode

### 3. Visual Changes

**Header title changes based on mode:**
- Editable: "Expense Approval Review"
- Read-only: "Expense Details (Read Only)"

**Info Banner (read-only only):**
```
ℹ️ This expense has already been approved/rejected. View only - no edits allowed.
```

## User Experience Flow

### Waiting Approval Tab
1. Click "Review" button
2. See full approval interface with approve/reject actions
3. Can approve or reject individual items
4. Can submit final decision

### Approved Tab  
1. Click "View Details" button
2. See read-only expense details
3. Info banner shows it's approved
4. NO approve/reject buttons visible
5. Can only view information and go back

### Benefits
✅ Prevents accidental edits to processed expenses
✅ Clear visual indication of read-only mode
✅ Maintains audit trail integrity
✅ Better user experience with appropriate button labels
✅ Clean separation between review and view modes
