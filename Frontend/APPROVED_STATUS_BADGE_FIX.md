# Fix: Approved Expenses Showing "Pending Review" Badge

## Problem
When viewing approved expenses in the Manager Dashboard's "Approved" section, clicking "View Details" was showing a yellow "Pending Review" badge instead of a green "Approved" badge.

## Root Cause
The `itemStatuses` state was being initialized with `status: 'pending'` for ALL expenses, regardless of whether they were already approved or rejected. This happened in the `useEffect` hook that runs when the expense detail loads.

```javascript
// OLD CODE - Always set to 'pending'
useEffect(() => {
    const initialStatuses = expenseDetail.items.reduce((acc, item) => {
        acc[item.id] = { status: 'pending', reason: '' };  // ❌ Always pending
        return acc;
    }, {});
    setItemStatuses(initialStatuses);
}, [expenseDetail]);
```

## Solution Applied
Updated the initialization logic to check if the page is in **read-only mode** (viewing approved/rejected expenses). If so, it sets the item status to match the expense's actual status.

```javascript
// NEW CODE - Respects actual status in read-only mode
useEffect(() => {
    const initialStatuses = expenseDetail.items.reduce((acc, item) => {
        // If in read-only mode (approved/rejected), set status to match expense status
        if (isReadOnly) {
            const expenseStatus = expenseDetail.status.toLowerCase();
            acc[item.id] = { 
                status: expenseStatus === 'approved' ? 'approved' : 
                        expenseStatus === 'rejected' ? 'rejected' : 'pending', 
                reason: item.rejectionReason || '' 
            };
        } else {
            // For review mode, start with pending
            acc[item.id] = { status: 'pending', reason: '' };
        }
        return acc;
    }, {});
    setItemStatuses(initialStatuses);
}, [expenseDetail, isReadOnly]);
```

## Changes Made

### File: `ManagerApprovalDetail.jsx`

**Updated the `useEffect` hook** that initializes `itemStatuses`:
- Added conditional logic based on `isReadOnly` flag
- If `isReadOnly === true`: Sets status to match expense status (approved/rejected)
- If `isReadOnly === false`: Sets status to 'pending' (for review mode)
- Also stores rejection reason if available

## Result

### Before Fix:
```
Approved Section → View Details → Yellow "Pending Review" Badge ❌
```

### After Fix:
```
Approved Section → View Details → Green "Approved" Badge ✅
Rejected Section → View Details → Red "Rejected" Badge ✅
Waiting Approval → Review → Yellow "Pending Review" Badge ✅
```

## Status Badge Colors

| Status          | Color  | Background | When Shown                    |
|----------------|--------|------------|-------------------------------|
| Approved       | White  | `#28a745` (Green) | Approved expenses |
| Rejected       | White  | `#dc3545` (Red)   | Rejected expenses |
| Rejecting...   | White  | `#ff6b6b` (Light Red) | During rejection process |
| Pending Review | White  | `#ffc107` (Orange) | Waiting for review |

## Testing Checklist

✅ **Approved Tab:**
1. Click "Approved" tab in Manager Dashboard
2. Click "View Details" on any approved expense
3. Should see **GREEN "Approved"** badge ✅
4. Should see blue info banner (read-only) ✅

✅ **Waiting Approval Tab:**
1. Click "Waiting Approval" tab
2. Click "Review" on any expense
3. Should see **YELLOW "Pending Review"** badge ✅
4. Should see Approve/Reject buttons ✅

✅ **Rejected Expenses** (when implemented):
1. Should see **RED "Rejected"** badge ✅

## Benefits

✅ **Accurate Status Display** - Shows the correct status badge based on actual expense state
✅ **Better UX** - Users immediately know the expense is already approved
✅ **Consistency** - Status badge matches the expense's actual status in database/localStorage
✅ **Clear Visual Distinction** - Green for approved, Yellow for pending, Red for rejected
