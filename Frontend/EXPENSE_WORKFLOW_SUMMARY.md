# Expense Workflow Implementation Summary

## Overview
Implemented a complete expense management workflow with draft saving, editing, and submission functionality using localStorage for data persistence.

## Features Implemented

### 1. **NewExpenseSubmission Page** (`/employee/new-expense`)
- ✅ Create new expense forms
- ✅ Save expenses as drafts
- ✅ Edit existing drafts
- ✅ Submit expenses for approval
- ✅ View-only mode after submission
- ✅ Redirects to dashboard after submission

**Key Changes:**
- Added `useEffect` to load expense data when editing
- Implemented `handleSaveDraft()` to save to localStorage
- Updated `handleSubmit()` to:
  - Save to expenses localStorage
  - Remove from drafts if editing a draft
  - Redirect to `/employee/dashboard`
- Form becomes read-only after submission
- All fields populate from passed expense data when editing

### 2. **DraftExpensesPage** (`/employee/drafts`)
- ✅ Displays all saved drafts from localStorage
- ✅ Edit button navigates to NewExpenseSubmission with draft data
- ✅ Submit button converts draft to pending expense
- ✅ Delete button removes draft from localStorage
- ✅ Real-time updates when drafts change

**Key Changes:**
- Load drafts from `localStorage.getItem('expenseDrafts')`
- `handleEdit()` navigates with state: `{ expense: draft }`
- `handleSubmit()` moves draft to expenses and redirects to dashboard
- Shows actual draft data (description, amount, date, paid by, etc.)

### 3. **EmployeeDashboard** (`/employee/dashboard`)
- ✅ Shows ALL expenses (drafts + submitted)
- ✅ Color-coded status badges:
  - **Gray** - Draft
  - **Yellow** - Pending Approval
  - **Green** - Approved
  - **Red** - Rejected
- ✅ Edit button for draft expenses
- ✅ View Details button for submitted expenses
- ✅ Approval history display
- ✅ Empty state when no expenses exist

**Key Changes:**
- Combines drafts and submitted expenses from localStorage
- `handleEdit()` only allows editing drafts
- Status-based UI rendering
- Detailed expense view with approval history

## Data Flow

### Creating a New Expense
1. User clicks "+ New Expense" → `/employee/new-expense`
2. Fills form
3. Two options:
   - **Save as Draft**: Saves to `expenseDrafts` → redirects to `/employee/drafts`
   - **Submit**: Saves to `expenses` with status `pending` → redirects to `/employee/dashboard`

### Editing a Draft
1. User goes to `/employee/drafts` or `/employee/dashboard`
2. Clicks "Edit" on a draft
3. Navigates to `/employee/new-expense` with expense data in state
4. Form pre-populates with draft data
5. Can update and either save as draft again or submit

### Submitting a Draft
1. From drafts page, click "Submit" button
2. Moves from `expenseDrafts` to `expenses` localStorage
3. Sets status to `pending`
4. Adds approval history entry
5. Redirects to `/employee/dashboard`

## LocalStorage Schema

### expenseDrafts
```json
[
  {
    "id": 1696789012345,
    "description": "Travel expense",
    "expenseDate": "2025-10-04",
    "category": "Travel",
    "paidBy": "John Doe",
    "totalAmount": "567",
    "currency": "USD",
    "remarks": "Client meeting",
    "receipt": null,
    "status": "draft",
    "savedAt": "2025-10-04T10:30:00.000Z"
  }
]
```

### expenses
```json
[
  {
    "id": 1696789012345,
    "description": "Travel expense",
    "expenseDate": "2025-10-04",
    "category": "Travel",
    "paidBy": "John Doe",
    "totalAmount": "567",
    "currency": "USD",
    "remarks": "Client meeting",
    "receipt": null,
    "status": "pending",
    "submittedAt": "2025-10-04T11:00:00.000Z",
    "history": [
      {
        "id": 1696789012346,
        "approver": "System",
        "status": "Pending Approval",
        "time": "11:00 4th Oct, 2025"
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

## Status Types
- **draft** - Saved but not submitted (editable)
- **pending** - Submitted, awaiting approval (read-only)
- **approved** - Approved by manager (read-only)
- **rejected** - Rejected by manager (read-only)

## Navigation Flow
```
/employee/dashboard
  ├─> + New Expense → /employee/new-expense (create)
  ├─> Edit (draft only) → /employee/new-expense (edit)
  └─> View Details → Shows approval history

/employee/drafts
  ├─> Edit → /employee/new-expense (edit)
  ├─> Submit → Moves to pending → /employee/dashboard
  └─> Delete → Removes from drafts

/employee/new-expense
  ├─> Save as Draft → /employee/drafts
  └─> Submit → /employee/dashboard
```

## User Experience

### Editable States
- ✅ New expense form (no data)
