Example: India → INR
```

Employee selects currency → Enters amount → System converts to company currency
Example: Submit €100 → Auto-converts to ₹9,013.04 (if company currency is INR)
```

### 3. Manager Approval:
```
Manager views expense → Sees both original and converted amounts
Example Display:

## Technical Details

### Exchange Rate Calculation:
All conversions go through USD as base:
```
From EUR to INR:
1. EUR → USD: 100 / 0.92 = 108.70 USD
2. USD → INR: 108.70 * 83.12 = 9,035.34 INR
```

### Data Storage:
**localStorage keys:**
- `companyCurrency` - Company's default currency (e.g., "USD")
- `companyName` - Company name
- `companyCountry` - Selected country

### Currency Formatting:
```javascript
formatCurrency(1000, 'USD') → "$1,000.00"
formatCurrency(1000, 'INR') → "₹1,000.00"
formatCurrency(1000, 'EUR') → "€1,000.00"
```

### 1. Live Exchange Rates API Integration:
```javascript
// Placeholder function ready for API integration

```

### 2. Historical Rates:
- Store exchange rates at time of expense submission
