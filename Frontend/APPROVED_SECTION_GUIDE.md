# Manager Dashboard - Approved Section Enhancement

## Overview
The Manager Dashboard now properly handles read-only viewing of approved/rejected expenses, preventing accidental modifications to already-processed expenses.

---

## Changes Made

### 1. Manager Dashboard (ManagerDashboard.jsx)

#### Button Text Changes
- **Waiting Approval Tab:** "Review" (indicates action required)
- **Approved/Reviewed Tab:** "View Details" (indicates view-only)

#### Navigation Enhancement
Now passes expense status to detail page:
- `isReadOnly` flag (true for approved/rejected)
- `fromTab` (which tab the user came from)
- `expense` object (full expense data)

---

### 2. Manager Approval Detail (ManagerApprovalDetail.jsx)

#### Read-Only Mode Features

**Visual Indicator:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ ℹ️ This expense has already been approved. View only - no   │
│    edits allowed.                                            │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Hidden Elements (in read-only mode):**
- ❌ Approve/Reject buttons on expense items
- ❌ Rejection reason textarea
- ❌ Submit/Cancel buttons for rejections
- ❌ "Submit Final Decision" section

**Visible Elements (always shown):**
- ✅ Employee Information

  - 🟢 Green: Approved
  - 🔴 Red: Rejected
  - 🟡 Orange: Pending
- ✅ Reviewed On date (when applicable)

## Technical Implementation

### State Management
```javascript
// Passed via React Router navigation state
{
  isReadOnly: boolean,      // true for approved/rejected
  fromTab: string,          // 'waitingApproval', 'approved', etc.
  expense: object           // full expense data
}
```

### Conditional Rendering
```javascript
// Example: Hide action buttons in read-only mode
{!isReadOnly && itemStatuses[item.id]?.status === 'pending' && (
  <div style={styles.itemActions}>
    <button onClick={handleReject}>Reject</button>
    <button onClick={handleApprove}>Approve</button>
  </div>
)}
```

### Color Coding
- **Approved:** `#10b981` (Green)
- **Rejected:** `#ef4444` (Red)
- **Pending:** `#f59e0b` (Orange)
- **Info Banner:** `#2196f3` (Blue)
